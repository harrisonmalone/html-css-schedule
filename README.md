- Break down second part of morning challenge, developer tools, looking at inspector 
- The cornerstones of the world wide web
- HTML CSS and JavaScript
- HTML = structure / content
- CSS = layout / style
- JavaScript = behavior / make website dynamic
- JavaScript can be front end or back end (with Node), don't worry about JavaScript for now, let's get good at writing clean HTML and CSS for the next week and a half
- Live server VSCode extension
- Using my website as an example of basic HTML, very minimal CSS going on, lets try to build it, we want you to be able to write clean HTML so it works well together with your CSS
- HTML files and how that creates a URL, localhost replaced with whatever I have as a domain name, directories and how that works with HTML files
- Shortcut in VSCode with ! + tab, what this generates
- Talk about the head vs body, refer to `head.html`

12 - 3 (lunch break 1 - 2)
- Harrison talking about HTML elements
- Developing my website [harrisonmalone.com](http://harrisonmalone.com)
- HTML5 vs older HTML
- HTML5 introduced things like `<nav>` and `<footer>`, these are the two most important ones, can use other stuff but no real need to unless there's a use case (svg, html media)
- I'm happy for you to `<div>` it up
